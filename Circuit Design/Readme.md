### 1. Initial Circuit Sketch
- Create a detailed sketch of the circuit using LTSpice with the basic inverting and non inverting amplifiing circuits we learned in operational amplifier circuits. Then simulated them using NI Multisim.
- List all components and their connections as we have to select 3 ranges in the amplifier and the overload protection.

### 2. Circuit Simulation Using NI Multisim
- Model the circuit in NI Multisim.
- Conduct two separate simulations:
  - Voltmeter Simulation: Verify voltage measurement and calibration.
  - Power Supply Simulation: Verify stability and output characteristics.
- Combine simulations into a single setup to ensure compatibility and functionality.

### 3. Prototyping on Breadboard
- Assemble the circuit on a breadboard.
- Debug and resolve any issues.
- Calibrate the circuit for optimal performance.
