# PCB Overview

This project involves the design, construction, and testing of an analog voltmeter circuit along with its associated power supply. The circuit was initially prototyped on a breadboard, then implemented on custom PCBs. The power supply circuit is designed as a single-layer PCB, while the range amplifier PCB is a two-layer design.

## PCB Details

### Power Supply Circuit

- **PCB Configuration**: The power supply circuit is designed on a single-layer PCB.
- **Manufacturing Details**: The power supply PCB was manufactured locally in Sri Lanka, leveraging a domestic PCB printing shop.
- **Component Type**: All components used in the power supply circuit are through-hole components.

### Range Amplifier PCB

- **PCB Configuration**: The range amplifier PCB is designed on a two-layer PCB.
- **Manufacturing Details**: PCB was fabricated through JLCPCB, utilizing their online PCB manufacturing service.
- **Component Type**: All components used in the range amplifier circuit are through-hole components.

## Testing and Verification

The circuit was extensively simulated across different voltage ranges (0-2.5V, 0-5V, and 0-10V) to ensure functionality and accuracy. After successful soldering, the circuit was tested using an oscilloscope and other necessary equipment to verify functionality and performance.

## Future Developments

As a beginner-level project, this prototype utilizes through-hole components. Future plans involve redesigning the PCBs using surface-mount device (SMD) components to achieve a more compact and efficient design.
